# Grid Code Compliance with MATLAB/Simulink

Voltage and frequency grid codes, such as IEEE 1547-2018, dictate how distributed generation, such as utility-scale solar and wind, must remain connected during grid fault events. These examples show how you can evaluate grid code compliance in MATLAB against historical measured data from PMUs. Additionally, Simulink blocks provide a path to evaluate grid code compliance of simulated systems and protection logic.

## Video Walkthrough of Example:
For more information and a video walk-through, these examples are used in the "Renewable Grid Integration Studies with Simscape Electrical" Webinar to evaluate grid code compliance of renewable and distributed resources: https://www.mathworks.com/videos/renewable-grid-integration-studies-with-simscape-electrical-1543529438031.html

## Getting Started with this Example:
To run this demo:
1. Extract the files to a directory and navigate to that folder in MATLAB
2. Open the "HistoricalEvents" folder to run the "analyzePMUdata.mlx" file to see how historical grid code data can be analyzed
3. Open the "GridCode_WindSystem" folder to run the "pmuReplay.slx" Simulink model to see how grid code checks can be applied to a model

## Toolbox Requirements:
- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Simscape
- Simscape Electrical
